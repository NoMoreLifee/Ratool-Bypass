# RaToolBypass

**RaToolBypass** is a tool designed to bypass the protection set by **RaTool**, a software that prevents USB devices from being accessed or used. RaTool is usually password-protected, but this tool provides a workaround method to remove that restriction.

> ⚠️ This tool is for educational and recovery purposes only. Do **not** use it to bypass security measures on devices you don't own.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔓 Bypass RaTool password protection.
- 📁 Displays the file path where the protection is applied.
- 🧹 Allows manual removal if automatic bypass fails.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run as Administrator**  
   - Right-click the tool and choose **"Run as administrator"**.

2. **Click the Bypass Button**  
   - The tool will attempt to remove the RaTool restrictions automatically.

3. **If it doesn’t work:**  
   - A `.txt` file will open with the exact path where RaTool's protection settings are stored.
   - Navigate to that path and delete the file or folder manually.

4. **Success Check**  
   - If the bypass is successful, nothing will pop up.
   - If manual deletion is required, follow the instructions in the `.txt` file.

## 📌 Notes

- Administrator privileges are required for the tool to work properly.
- Do not use this tool for malicious purposes.
